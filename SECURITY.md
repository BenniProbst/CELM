# Security Policy

Project: **CELM**
Vendor: **BEP Venture UG**
Security Contact: **bep.venture.ug@gmail.com**

## 1. Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report suspected vulnerabilities **privately** to **bep.venture.ug@gmail.com** with the subject "Security Report: CELM". Include:
- A clear description of the issue and potential impact.
- Minimal, reproducible steps or proof-of-concept.
- Affected version(s) and environment (OS, compiler, configuration).
- Any logs, stack traces, or screenshots.

**Acknowledgement timeline:** We aim to acknowledge your report within **14 calendar days**. We will then coordinate on investigation, remediation, and coordinated disclosure timelines.

> **Please do not** create public GitHub issues for security reports.

## 2. Supported Versions
We follow Semantic Versioning. Security fixes are generally provided for the most recent minor versions of the latest two (2) release lines, for example:
- `0.2.x` (current) — receiving fixes
- `0.1.x` (previous) — receiving critical fixes only
  Older lines may be out of support unless separately agreed.

## 3. Scope
In scope:
- Official CELM source code and binary releases published by **BEP Venture UG**.
- Default configuration and documented features.

Out of scope:
- Third-party dependencies and tools (report to their maintainers).
- User-modified builds, forks, or unapproved patches.
- Social engineering, physical attacks, or attacks on infrastructure not owned by **BEP Venture UG**.

## 4. Ground Rules for Testing (Responsible Research)
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond the minimal proof-of-concept needed to demonstrate impact.
- Do not access, modify, or exfiltrate data that does not belong to you.
- Do not degrade availability for other users (no denial-of-service or brute-force testing against production services).
- Perform testing only in your own environment or with explicit permission.
- Comply with applicable law at all times.

## 5. Coordinated Disclosure
Please allow us a reasonable time to investigate and release a fix before any public disclosure. We will provide credit in release notes (optional, with your consent). Do not share details publicly without our written approval until a fix is available.

## 6. Safe Harbor
If you follow this policy in good faith, we will not pursue legal action for security research activities that align with the "Ground Rules for Testing," and we will consider such activities authorized for the limited purpose of reporting vulnerabilities to us.

## 7. No Bounty by Default
We do not operate a bug-bounty program at this time. We may, at our discretion, offer a token of appreciation or credit.

## 8. Contact & Legal
