# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct applies to the entire **CELM** project by **BEP Venture UG** — including the repository, Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, Wiki, chat, conferences/meetups, and any other project-related communication (online and offline).

## 1. Our Pledge
We are committed to a welcoming, respectful, and professional environment. We welcome contributions from people of all backgrounds and identities. Disagreement is natural; we keep it technical and constructive.

## 2. Expected Behavior
- Be respectful; focus on ideas, not individuals.
- Give constructive, evidence-based feedback; assume good faith.
- Keep discussions on topic and at a professional tone.
- Follow project guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, LICENSE).

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior (examples)
- Harassment, discrimination, insults, trolling, or personal attacks.
- Sexualized language/imagery; unwelcome sexual attention.
- Doxxing or disclosure of others' private information.
- Threats, intimidation, incitement to violence.
- Persistent disruption of discussions or ignoring moderator requests.

## 4. Scope
This Code applies wherever project communication occurs, and when individuals represent the project (e.g., talks, social media while acting in an official capacity).

## 5. Enforcement Responsibilities
Maintainers moderate spaces, clarify rules, and apply measures. They will listen to all sides, act fairly, and document key steps. In case of conflicts of interest, maintainers recuse themselves.

## 6. Reporting a Problem
Report violations privately to **bep.venture.ug@gmail.com**. Please include, where possible, **time**, **place (URL)**, **participants**, **description**, and any **screenshots/logs**.
We acknowledge receipt within **14 calendar days** and keep reporters reasonably informed of next steps. We treat reports confidentially and store only what is necessary for resolution. (Security vulnerabilities: see **SECURITY.md** and contact **bep.venture.ug@gmail.com**.)

## 7. Enforcement Guidelines (Graduated Consequences)
Depending on severity and context, maintainers may apply, for example:
1. **Correction** — clarification and request to stop.
2. **Warning** — written warning in a private channel.
3. **Temporary Limitations** — e.g., read-only, muted in specific areas.
4. **Temporary Ban** — time-limited exclusion from project spaces.
5. **Permanent Ban** — removal from all project spaces.
6. **Escalation** — report to platform operators or event organizers (only if necessary and lawful).

## 8. Appeals / Review
Affected parties may request a review of an enforcement decision within **14 calendar days** by writing to **bep.venture.ug@gmail.com**. A different maintainer without a conflict of interest will review the case.

## 9. Data Protection
We minimize data collection and retention related to reports. Where applicable, see our privacy notice. We do not publish incident details that could identify reporters or victims unless legally required.

## 10. Relation to Project Rules
This Code complements **CONTRIBUTING.md**, **SECURITY.md**, and **LICENSE**. If documents conflict, project leadership will clarify the applicable rule for the case at hand.
