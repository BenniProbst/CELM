**Status**: ARCHIVED (prototype)
**Reason**: ELM is the older prototype of CELM and is no longer maintained as a standalone project.
**Documentation**: The canonical documentation for ELM has been integrated into CELM docs.

## Summary

ELM was an early prototype that evolved into CELM. The standalone ELM project is
retired and replaced by CELM as the active implementation. All current design,
architecture, and research notes are maintained under the CELM documentation.
